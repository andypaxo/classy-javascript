# Classy JavaScript

Classy JavaScript will be a short course to get a handful of developers ramped
up on JS development. The course is aimed at folk with decent prior knowledge
of programming and some experience in JS, but without requiring  deep
understanding of the language.

This is all in preparation for working on JavaScript-based mobile applications
and will focus primarily on building up a firm grasp on the language itself
without relying on the use of frameworks. (Although we will cover one or two
handy libraries along the way).
